# DATA INTEGRATION - ER DIAGRAM

## Scenario

The setting is an auto dealer. In this company, there are 3 departments, including:
  1.Inventory
  2. Sales
  3. Customer relations
Each department manages their information differently. They have merged with a dealer of pre-owned cars, and they need to integrate their data.

Create ER diagrams for the data integration.
